The 7th Orogenic Lherzolite Meeting will take place from xx to xx xxxx 2024 in NW Spain around the stunning Cabo Ortegal massif. This region is known for the remarkable outcrops of several kilometre-scale mantle bodies (mainly harzburgites and Grt-bearing pyroxenites) associated with high-P (Opx-free) granulites, eclogites and high-P gneisses.

Join us for this exciting event, where researchers and experts in the field will gather to share knowledge and explore the latest advances in the processes operating in the mantle and at the transition between the upper mantle and the lower crust. We invite you to submit your innovative and groundbreaking contributions to the conference. We ask you to forward this information among colleagues who may be interested in participating.

Mark your calendars and stay tuned for further updates on registration,  abstract submission, and key dates. We look forward to welcoming you to  the 7th Orogenic Lherzolite Meeting in Spain, where fruitful discussions and valuable networking await!

# About

The International Orogenic Lherzolite Conference aims to bring together specialists in mantle processes to key orogenic mantle peridotites (and related rocks) outcrops worldwide and to share and discuss the latest advances in the processes operating in the upper mantle and at the transition between the upper mantle and the lower crust. 

## History

The first International Orogenic Lherzolite meeting was held in Montpellier (France) in 1990 around the Lherz peridotite outcrop in the French Pyrenees. Since then, a total of six Orogenic Lherzolite conferences have been held around the world:

1. 1990 - Montpellier (France) - Lherz peridotite in the French Pyrenees.
2. 1995 - Granada (Spain) - Ronda (Betic Codillera, Spain) and Beni Bousera (Rif Mountains, Morocco) orogenic peridotites.
3. 1999 - Pavia (Italy) - Ivrea, Malenco, Lanzo, Erro-Tobio peridotite outcrops
4. 2002 - Samani (Japan) - Horoman Peridotite Complex in Hokkaido, deep-seated plutonic and metamorphic rocks of the Hidaka Metamorphic Belt, Hayachine and Miyamori ultramafic complexes (Kitakami mountains, NE Honshu island), and deep-seated xenoliths from the Southwest Japan Arc
5. 2008 - Shasta City, California (USA) - Josephine and Trinity (western USA) peridotites.
6. 2014 - Marrakech (Morocco) - Beni Bousera peridotite and Middle and Anti-Atlas mantle xenoliths and ophiolites.
