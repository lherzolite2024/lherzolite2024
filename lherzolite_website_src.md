The 7th Orogenic Lherzolite Meeting will take place from 30 September to 6 October 2024 in NW Spain around the stunning Cabo Ortegal massif and the city of Oviedo. Cabo Ortegal region is known for the remarkable outcrops of several kilometre-scale mantle bodies (mainly serpentinized harzburgites and Grt-bearing pyroxenites) associated with high-P (Opx-free) granulites, eclogites, and high-P paragneisses.

Join us for this exciting event, where researchers and experts in the field will gather to share knowledge and explore the latest advances in the processes operating in the mantle and at the transition between the upper mantle and the lower crust. We invite you to submit your innovative and groundbreaking contributions to the conference. We ask you to forward this information among colleagues who may be interested in participating.

Mark your calendars and stay tuned for further updates on registration,  abstract submission, and key dates. We look forward to welcoming you to the 7th Orogenic Lherzolite Meeting in Spain, where fruitful discussions and valuable networking await!

# About

The International Orogenic Lherzolite Conference aims to unite specialists in mantle processes to key orogenic mantle peridotite (and related rocks) outcrops worldwide. The conference provides a platform to exchange knowledge and engage in  discussions regarding the latest advancements in the processes occurring in the upper mantle and at the transition between the upper mantle and  the lower crust. Contributions typically cover a wide range of topics, including melting processes, crustal recycling, significance of mafic lithologies, metasomatism, lithosphere evolution through rejuvenation/refertilization, supra-subduction fluid/melt/deformation processes, feedbacks between deformation and melt segregation/migration, field and experimental studies on mantle/lower crust rocks deformation, geophysical imaging of the Moho transition, mantle structures and flow, or mineral resources related to mantle rocks.

## History

The first International Orogenic Lherzolite meeting was held in Montpellier (France) in 1990 around the Lherz peridotite outcrop in the French Pyrenees. Since then, a total of six Orogenic Lherzolite conferences have been held around the world:

1. 1990 - Montpellier (France) - Lherz peridotite in the French Pyrenees.
2. 1995 - Granada (Spain) - Ronda (Betic Codillera, Spain) and Beni Bousera (Rif Mountains, Morocco) orogenic peridotites.
3. 1999 - Pavia (Italy) - Ivrea, Malenco, Lanzo, Erro-Tobio peridotite outcrops
4. 2002 - Samani (Japan) - Horoman Peridotite Complex in Hokkaido, deep-seated plutonic and metamorphic rocks of the Hidaka Metamorphic Belt, Hayachine and Miyamori ultramafic complexes (Kitakami mountains, NE Honshu island), and deep-seated xenoliths from the Southwest Japan Arc
5. 2008 - Shasta City, California (USA) - Josephine and Trinity (western USA) peridotites.
6. 2014 - Marrakech (Morocco) - Beni Bousera peridotite and Middle and Anti-Atlas mantle xenoliths and ophiolites.

# Practical information

In a nutshell, the 7th Orogenic Lherzolite program is as follows:

**Pre-Conference Excursion**:
This is a two-day excursion that will take place in the [Cabo Ortegal UNESCO Global Geopark](https://www.unesco.org/en/iggp/geoparks/cabo-ortegal), situated in the region of Galicia in north-western Spain, from September 30th to October 1st 2024.  On the 29th of September we will already be staying in the surroundings of the Geopark. One day of the excursion will be devoted entirely to the mantle section (harzburgites and pyroxenites), while the other day will be devoted to the other high-pressure section adjacent to the mantle, including "pyrigarnites" and hornblendites, Opx-free granulites and eclogites. We will give precise instructions on how to get to the Pre-Conference excursion later on.

**Congress**:
The Congress itself will be held in the city of Oviedo (Asturias, Spain) from 2 to 4 October. More info soon.

**Post-Conference Excursions**:
Following the Congress, we offer the opportunity for smaller groups to embark on different short excursions such as less accessible areas of the Cabo Ortegal massif and mantle outcrops in the Pyrenees. Please note that specific details and destinations for the post-Conference field visits are yet to be determined.

> üö®**Accommodation Information**üö®
> Accommodation in the field trips will be managed directly by the organisation and the cost will be included in the excursion registration fee. However, for the congress in Oviedo, accommodation will not be included in the registration fee and **participants are responsible for arranging their own accommodation**. We recommend booking early to secure the best prices and availability. Please refer to the accommodation section below for detailed information and helpful tips.

## Venue

[Oviedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oviedo) is a vibrant city in the region of Asturias, Spain. Nestled in the north-western part of the country and being the capital city of Asturias, Oviedo offers a rich blend of history, culture and modern amenities. The city is located in the Cantabrian Mountains, surrounded by green landscapes. It is a medium-size (220 000 inhabitants) walkable city, allowing visitors to explore its charming streets and discover hidden gems at their leisure. The city centre offers a pedestrian-friendly environment, making it easy to navigate and ensuring that congress attendees can easily access the venue, as well as enjoy the numerous restaurants, cafes, and shops that line the streets.

With a history dating back to Roman times, Oviedo has preserved its architectural heritage while embracing contemporary development. The city has remarkable monuments that reflect its past. It is particularly renowned for its [Asturian pre-Romanesque architecture](https://www.spain.info/en/top/asturias-pre-romanesque/) style, first appeared in the 8th century, which showcases a unique and influential style from the early Middle Ages. The city is home to a number of exceptional pre-Romanesque buildings, including the Santa Mar√≠a del Naranco palace, the San Juli√°n de los Prados and San Miguel de Lillo churches, the _C√°mara Santa_ (Holy Chamber) or the Foncalada fountain, all of them recognized as [UNESCO World Heritage sites](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/312/). Also, the Gothic-style Oviedo Cathedral, built between the centuries 13th and 16th, stands as an impressive example of medieval architecture. Oviedo's historic old town, known as the _Casco Antiguo_, is a maze of narrow streets and squares, adorned with beautiful buildings and picturesque plazas.

Lastly, the building that houses the geology studies of the University of Oviedo, built in 1965 by the architect Ignacio √Ålvarez Castelao, is a protected architectural gem which is worth a visit. The building structure comprises two distinct yet interconnected buildings ‚Äîthe departmental building and the lecture hall‚Äî nestled within a spacious open area that includes a geological garden. A notable feature of this structure is the lecture hall, which expands akin to the intricate spiral of a mollusc shell. The buildings integrate several works of art linked to different disciplines in the field of geology. The departmental building also houses a free geology museum, a mainstay of geoscience outreach in the region.
