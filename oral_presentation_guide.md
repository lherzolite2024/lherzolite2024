## General guidelines

Oral presentations are organized into sessions, as indicated in the program, along with the specific time of each contribution. Sessions are divided into five time blocks per day, each lasting 60 minutes. There is a single conference room dedicated to all oral presentations.

- **Time Allotment:** Each oral presentation is allocated a total of 20 minutes, including 5 minutes for discussion and audience questions (i.e. 15 + 5 min). Check the schedule for your talk on the [programme website](https://lherzolite2024.github.io/programme/). Please note that the allocated presentation time must not be exceeded.
- **Live Presentations:** All presentations must be delivered live and in person. <mark>Pre-recorded presentations are not permitted</mark>.
- **Presentation Equipment:** The meeting room is equipped with a Windows 11 laptop with updated versions of PowerPoint (from Microsoft Office 365) and Adobe Acrobat. There is also software for viewing multimedia files (images and video). It also has an Internet connection and sound system.  <mark>If you need special software for your presentation, please contact us in advance to try to find a solution. To ensure a smooth and timely event, it is not allowed to connect your computer to the projector unless there is a justified reason and only after consultation with the organisers.</mark>


## How to prepare for your oral presentation

- **Font Size:** Please use a minimum font size of **20 pt** to ensure that your slides are easily readable by everyone in the room.
- **Aspect Ratio:** You may create your slides in either **16:9** or **4:3** aspect ratios, though <mark>**4:3** is recommended</mark> to maximize screen space (see below)

- **File Formats:** Acceptable file formats for presentations include `*.pdf`, `*.ppt/pptx`, `*.pps/ppsx`, `*.png`, `*.jpg`, and `*.mp4`.
- **Try to use common fonts** to avoid surprises during your PowerPoint presentation (if the font you use is not installed on the laptop, PowerPoint will substitute it and it will not look the same as the original). Alternatively, you can embed the fonts or convert the presentation to a PDF format.
- **Image Credits:** Ensure that all images, charts, and external materials used in your presentation are properly credited to their respective sources.
- **Color Accessibility:** When designing charts and maps, try using scientific color schemes that are accessible to individuals with color vision deficiencies.
