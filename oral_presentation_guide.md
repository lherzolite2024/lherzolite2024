## General guidelines

Oral presentations are organized into sessions, as indicated in the program, along with the specific time of each contribution. Sessions are divided into five time blocks per day, each lasting 60 minutes. There is a single conference room dedicated to all oral presentations.

- **Time Allotment:** Each oral presentation is allocated a total of 20 minutes, including 5 minutes for discussion and audience questions (i.e. 15 + 5 min). Check the schedule for your talk on the [programme website](https://lherzolite2024.github.io/programme/). Please note that the allocated presentation time must not be exceeded.
- **Live Presentations:** All presentations must be delivered live and in person. <mark>Pre-recorded presentations are not permitted</mark>.
- **Presentation Equipment:** The meeting room is equipped with a beamer connected to a laptop PC Windows 11 environment with updated versions of PowerPoint (Microsoft Office 365) and Adobe Acrobat Pro. There is also software for viewing multimedia files (images and video). It also has an Internet connection and sound system.  <mark>If you need special software for your presentation, please contact us in advance to try to find a solution. To ensure a smooth and timely event, it is not allowed to connect your computer to the projector unless there is a justified reason and only after consultation with the organisers.</mark>
- A laser pointer, a remote control slide projector and a microphone (for question time) will be available.
- Speakers should **bring their presentation on a USB memory stick** to transfer to the computer in the presentation room. Room staff will assist you in uploading your file to the computer. Speakers should arrive in their session room at least 10 minutes before the start of their session to upload their file (if not done before) and introduce yourself to the session chair before the start of the session. Files can also be uploaded well in advance, during breaks between sessions. It is advisable to bring both a PPTX and a PDF version of the presentation. To facilitate our work, please the file name should be in the following format, including your name, day and block, for example: ``Wed_b1_Lissenberg.pptx`` (Wednesday, oral block 1) ``Thur_b2_Morishita.pptx`` (Thursday, oral block 2), and so on.


## How to prepare for your oral presentation

- **Font Size:** Please use a minimum font size of **20 pt** to ensure that your slides are easily readable by everyone in the room.
- **Aspect Ratio:** You may create your slides in either **16:9** or **4:3** aspect ratios, though <mark>**4:3** is recommended</mark> to maximize screen space (see below)

- **File Formats:** Acceptable file formats for presentations include `*.pdf`, `*.ppt/pptx`, `*.pps/ppsx`, `*.png`, `*.jpg`, and `*.mp4`.
- **Try to use common fonts** to avoid surprises during your PowerPoint presentation (if the font you use is not installed on the laptop, PowerPoint will substitute it and it will not look the same as the original). Alternatively, you can embed the fonts or convert the presentation to a PDF format.
- A wise guideline for the **number of slides** in your presentation is 1-1.5 minutes per slide. Thus the expected number of slides in an oral presentation is 10-15 for a 15 minute oral presentation, depending on the density of information per slide.
- **Image Credits:** Ensure that all images, charts, and external materials used in your presentation are properly credited to their respective sources.
- **Color Accessibility:** When designing charts and maps, try using scientific color maps that are accessible to individuals with color vision deficiencies.
