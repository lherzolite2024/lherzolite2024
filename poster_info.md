## Poster boards

- Poster boards are in **landscape format**, and authors can make use of the full dimensions up to A0 format: **1189 mm width × 841 mm height** (46.81 x 33.11 inch).
- Pins are used for attaching the poster to the poster board. These  are available at the poster board. In case of missing pins, please  consult our staff at the facility desk in the respective poster area.
- For each poster board, there is a desk to place a private laptop or other device for additional presentations. European-type power sockets  are available.
- The number of each poster abstract and of its corresponding poster board is provided in the appropriate session programme. The first part  of this number indicates the poster area and the second part the running number of the respective poster board in that area. Example: poster A17.

## On-site poster display and attendance time

- The **display time is 10:00-19:15**, while the **attendance time is 17:05-19:15**. The poster can remain hanging the whole day but must be taken down by 19:15 as this marks the start of the clean-up period.  **Any posters remaining during the clean-up phase will be removed and disposed of by the conference staff**. 

## Poster preparation

- Place the title of your abstract clearly at the top of the poster to allow viewers to easily identify your abstract. Indicate the authors'  names and address information in order to allow interested viewers to  contact you for more information. Include your ORCid.
- Prepare all diagrams or charts neatly and legibly beforehand, in a  size sufficient to be read at a distance of 1.5–2.0 m. We recommended  using a minimum font size of 16pt. Use different colours or line-types  for each line or bars contained in your graph or chart.
- Please ensure that the correct author is assigned presenting author for the abstract.
