## Poster boards

- **Format**: Poster boards are in **vertical/portrait format** (taller than wide). Authors may use the full dimensions up to **950 mm width × 2300 mm height** (37.4 × 90.6 inches). <mark>For space and uniformity, we recommend using A0-sized vertical posters (841 × 1189 mm or 33.1 × 46.8 inches).</mark>
- **Mounting**: Double-sided tape will be provided to attach the poster to the board. Each board will have four pieces of tape, and additional tape can be requested from the conference staff if needed.
- **Poster Location:** Each poster's corresponding board number and abstract number can be found in the session program.

## On-site poster display and attendance time

- **Display Time:** Posters will be displayed from 09:00 to 19:00. Specific attendance times (when presenters should be available at their posters) are from 14:00 to 16:00.
- **Poster Removal:** The poster can remain hanging for the duration of the congress but must be taken down by 16:00 on Friday, September 4.  **Any posters left after this time will be removed and discarded by conference staff.**

## Poster preparation

- **Title and Author Details**: Ensure that the title of your abstract is clearly visible at the top of the poster for easy identification. Include the names and contact information of all authors, including their affiliations.
- **Readability**: Diagrams, charts, and text should be large enough to be legible from a distance of 1.5–2.0 meters. We recommend using a minimum font size of 16 pt for the main text. Use distinct colors or line types for different elements in your graphs or charts to aid clarity.
- **Presenting Author:** Verify that the correct author is assigned as the presenting author in the programme.
- **Oral Summary:** <mark>Poster presenters should prepare a 1-minute oral presentation to explain the key points of their research.</mark> You should also prepare a single slide to accompany this 1-minute presentation.

## Poster printing service

For those interested, the Publications Service of the University of Oviedo offers a poster printing service, which operates as follows:

- Send the poster via email to **vanessa.fuo (at) uniovi (dot) es** as an attachment, or use an alternative method if the file is too large.
- Posters will be ready for collection on the first day of the congress.
- The cost for an A0 color print is €18.15 (VAT included), with a 15% handling fee, bringing the total to €22 per poster. Payment can be made online by credit card, using the same process as for congress registration.
