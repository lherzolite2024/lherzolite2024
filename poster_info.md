## Poster boards

- Poster boards are in **vertical/portrait format** (taller than wide), and authors can make use of the full dimensions up to: **950 mm width × 2300 mm height** (37.4 x 90.6 inch). <mark>The use of A0 posters (841 x 1189 mm or 33.1 x 46.8 inch) is recommended for reasons of space and format uniformity.</mark>
- Double-sided tape will be used to attach the poster to the board. Each panel comes with 4 pieces of tape. If more tape is needed, you can order more from our staff.
- The number of each poster abstract and of its corresponding poster board is provided in the session programme.

## On-site poster display and attendance time

- The display time is 9:00-19:15, while the attendance time is (**to be determined)**. The poster can remain hanging for the duration of the congress, but must be taken down by 17:00 on Friday 4.  **Any remaining posters will be removed and disposed of by conference staff**.

## Poster preparation

- Place the title of your abstract clearly at the top of the poster to allow viewers to easily identify your abstract. Indicate the authors' names and address information in order to allow interested viewers to contact you for more information. It is encouraged to include your ORCid.
- Prepare all diagrams or charts neatly and legibly beforehand, in a  size sufficient to be read at a distance of 1.5–2.0 m. We recommended  using a minimum font size of 16pt. Use different colours or line-types for each line or bars contained in your graph or chart.
- Please ensure that the correct author is assigned presenting author for the abstract.
- <mark>Poster presenters should prepare a 2-minute oral presentation.</mark>
