### Main Text
Please provide an abstract of no more than 600 words, one figure or one table (included here), and a brief list of references. We kindly request that you refrain from using section headers (remove the Main Text header). While it's encouraged to include a summary figure, it's not obligatory.

As an example, here's a simple equation using LaTeX:

$$
\sin^2(a)+\cos^2(a) = 1
$$

You can also use the LaTeX inline mode $y=x^2$. For units, please follow the recommendations of Koefoed (1967). References should be included in the references section arranged first alphabetically and then chronologically if necessary. Use the Elsevier - Harvard’s style including full titles for formatting the references. You can utilize https://zbib.org/ to automatically format your references by providing the doi or the title of the source.

Abstracts will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee, who will decide about the direct acceptation of the abstract, provide advice for modifications or reject in case that they consider that an abstract has not have sufficient quality or do not fit within the broad topics of the meeting.
