**Geochemical and Petrological Perspectives**: Latest advancements in geochemical and petrological studies of mantle and high-P (granulites, eclogites) crustal rocks. Major and trace element rock composition, isotopic signatures, physic-chemical evolution, etc. This includes field-based and experimental approaches.

**Mantle-Crust Interaction and Melt Generation**: This session will focus on the processes of mantle-crust interaction and melt generation, including melting processes, melt transport and their impact on crustal evolution, crustal recycling, and the significance of (ultra)mafic lithologies in orogenic peridotites.

**Seismic and Geophysical Studies:** Present and discuss the results of seismic and geophysical studies related to mantle and high-P crustal rocks. Explore how these studies contribute to our understanding of mantle structure, composition and dynamics. Including modelling seismic or other physical rock properties.

**Thermodynamic and Numerical Modelling Approaches:** Showcase modelling efforts aimed at simulating conditions relevant to mantle and high-P rocks (granulites, eclogites). For example, discussing the significance of mineral reactions, phase equilibria, and mineral relations or simulating _P-T_ paths in subduction settings. Approaches comparing models and field-based cases are encouraged.

**Deformation in the Mantle and High-P Crustal rocks:** Showcase microstructural and textural (CPO) studies of mantle and high-P crustal rocks, rheological properties, experimental rock deformation.

**Tectonic Settings and Geological Context:** Examine the tectonic settings where specific mantle and high-*P* rocks found and originate. Discuss the geological context and implications for regional tectonics and plate dynamics.

**Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Future Directions:** Synthesis session covering overarching themes, cross-disciplinary interactions, development of new techniques or tools, and future research directions.



Maybe:

**Mantle carbon and volatile cycles**: This session could cover the role of the mantle in the carbon and volatile cycles of the Earth and low-temperature hydrothermal alteration (maybe included into the broader "Geochemical and Petrological Perspectives" or "Mantle-Crust Interaction and Melt Generation" sessions).

**Economic Geology:** Discuss any applied implications of mantle and high-P rocks such as their role in resource exploration, mining or other industrial applications. Sulphides, PGE (maybe included into the broader "Mantle-Crust Interaction and Melt Generation" session).
